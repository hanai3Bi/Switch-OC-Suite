This is continuation of Switch-OC-Suite just for my personal usage. This project is very dangerous and I do not recommend using it. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Overclocking Suite for Nintendo Switch consoles running Atmosphere CFW.

[Project Homepage](https://hanai3Bi.github.io/Switch-OC-Suite)

**DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

- Overclocking in general will shorten the lifespan of some hardware components. **YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any problem or potential damage** if unsafe frequencies are ENABLED in sys-clk-OC. Issues like asking for bypassing limit will BE IGNORED OR CLOSED WITHOUT REPLY.

- Due to HorizonOS design, instabilities from unsafe RAM clocks may cause filesystem corruption. **Always make backup before enabling DRAM OC.**

## Features

- Erista variant (HAC-001)
  - CPU Overclock (Safe: 1785 MHz)
    - Unsafe
      - Due to the limit of board power draw or power IC
      - Unlockable frequencies up to 2091 MHz
      - See [README for sys-clk-OC](https://github.com/hanai3Bi/Switch-OC-Suite/blob/master/Source/sys-clk-OC/README.md)

  - DRAM Overclock (Safe: 1862.4 MHz)

- Mariko variant (HAC-001-01, HDH-001, HEG-001)
  - CPU / GPU Overclock (Safe: 1963 / 998 MHz)
    - Unsafe
      - Due to the limit of board power draw or power IC
      - Unlockable frequencies up to 2397 / 1305 MHz or 2295 / 1267 MHz
      - See [README for sys-clk-OC](https://github.com/hanai3Bi/Switch-OC-Suite/blob/master/Source/sys-clk-OC/README.md)

  - DRAM Overclock (Safe: 1996.8 MHz)

- Modded sys-clk and ReverseNX-RT
  - Auto CPU Boost
    - For faster game loading
    - Enable CPU Boost (1785 MHz) when CPU Core#3 (System Core) is stressed (mainly I/O operations).
    - Effective only when charger is connected or governor is enabled.
    - This feature is considered unsafe on Erista, especially when combined with high GPU frequency or with governor enabled.

  - CPU & GPU frequency governor (Experimental)
    - Adjust frequency based on load. Might decrease power draw but can introduce stutters. Can be turned off for specific titles.

  - Set charging current (100 mA - 2000 mA) and charging limit (20% - 100%)
    - Long-term use of charge limit may render the battery gauge inaccurate. Performing full cycles could help recalibration, or try [battery_desync_fix_nx](https://github.com/CTCaer/battery_desync_fix_nx).

  - Global Profile
    - Designated a dummy title id `0xA111111111111111`.
    - Priority: "Temp overrides" > "Application profile" > "Global profile" > "System default".

  - Sync ReverseNX Mode
    - No need to change clocks manually after toggling modes in ReverseNX (-RT and -Tool)

- **[System Settings (Optional)](https://github.com/hanai3Bi/Switch-OC-Suite/blob/master/system_settings.md)**


## Installation

1. Download latest [release](https://github.com/hanai3Bi/Switch-OC-Suite/releases).

2. Copy all files in `SdOut` to the root of SD card.

3. Grab `x.x.x_loader.kip` for your Atmosphere version, rename it to `loader.kip` and place it in `/atmosphere/kips/`.

4. Customization via [online loader configurator](https://hanai3Bi.github.io/Switch-OC-Suite/#config):

    | CPU Boost  | 1785 MHz      | N/A          |
    | CPU Volt   | 1235 mV Max   | 1235 mV Max  |
    | GPU OC     | 1305 MHz Max  | N/A          |
    | RAM OC     | 1996 MHz Max  | 1862 MHz Max |
    | RAM Volt   | Disabled      | Disabled     |
    | RAM Timing | Auto-Adjusted | N/A          |

5. Hekate-ipl bootloader Only
   - Add `kip1=atmosphere/kips/loader.kip` to boot entry section in `bootloader/hekate_ipl.ini`.


## Build

<details>

Grab necessary patches from the repo, then compile sys-clk, ReverseNX-RT and Atmosphere loader with devkitpro.

Before compiling Atmosphere loader, run `patch.py` in `Atmosphere/stratosphere/loader/source/` to insert oc module into loader sysmodule.

When compilation is done, uncompress the kip to make it work with configurator: `hactool -t kip1 Atmosphere/stratosphere/loader/out/nintendo_nx_arm64_armv8a/release/loader.kip --uncompress=./loader.kip`
